# Contributing
Volunteers are welcomed to contribute to the Animatify iOS app codebase.

## Development instructions
Before developing, please read the [setup instructions](README.md).
We do all of our active development on the dev branch. Your pull requests will automatically be targeted at that branch by Github. To make merging easier, be sure you create your branches based on the develop branch.

## What can I work on?

If you're looking for some easy work, you can go through the code and refactor/add comments if you feel it's missing. If you're ready to pick up a more complex work, you can create animations and effects for the project.

When you've finished working on something, raise a merge request explaining the new features and how it works.


## How will I know that my contribution was accepted?
Your PR will be merged and this means that your contribution will be included in the upcoming release and in the README.
